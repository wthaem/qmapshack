# Documentation plan

Discussion: Maproom/qmapshack#1209. The picture tool is `.notes/QMS-1217-documentation-images.md`.

## Who needs what

| Who | Online docs | Offline help |
|---|---|---|
| Release user | latest release | installed release |
| Developer or user compiling a branch | does not matter | that branch, without building the docs |
| Writer or developer before a PR | does not matter | their local changes |

## Decisions

- Sphinx with MyST and Furo. Sources in `doc/index.md` and `doc/pages/`.
- One generated HTML tree, `doc/html/`, committed. No `.qch` or `.qhc` for QMapShack.
- Changing the text needs Python and `doc/requirements.txt` (`doc/tools/generate_html.py`); taking pictures
  also needs `QMS_DOC_MODE=ON`. The `doc` target only calls the script. Nobody else needs the tools.
- A doc PR holds Markdown, pictures and `doc/html/`. If a code PR's author cannot set this up, the
  maintainer adds the docs commit.
- GitHub never alters the repository. An Action publishes `doc/html/` of the latest release tag to Pages.
- Scope: an extended quick start, not an encyclopedia. Short sentences.

## Measured

Worst case, all wiki pages (96 pages, 630 images). `git gc`, then `git count-objects`:

| Change | `doc/html/` | `.qch` |
|---|---|---|
| base | 37 MB | 36 MB |
| one sentence | 4 files, +12 KiB | +13 KiB |
| new page | 101 files, +374 KiB | +45 KiB |

- A rebuild without changes changes nothing. A picture in `_images/` is byte-identical to its source, so
  history holds it once and a checkout twice.
- A fresh clone stores the 20 `QMSHelp.qch` versions in 153.6 MB, the same versions repacked in 44 MB.
  Why GitHub's pack is larger is not known.
- 625 of the wiki index's 628 links converted to `{index}` entries by script.

## Steps

1. Test branch `docs-html-test`: F1, search, index and dark mode on each OS.
2. Merge the help change and the `doc` target.
3. Packaging: `msvc_64/copyfiles.bat`, `CopyFilesGis.bat`, the NSIS scripts, `MacOSX/bundle-qmapshack.sh`.
4. `release.py`: drop the QMS part of the wiki step.
5. Pages Action.
6. Style guide: wthaem's draft as a PR. Settle picture vs image.
7. Rewrite the quick start as the first real page. Link to the wiki for what is not written yet.
8. Concept pages: concepts, data preparation, workspace and database.
9. Freeze the wiki with pointers to the new pages. Convert its index entries for pages that are carried over.

## Open

- Windows and macOS are not tested.
- A build finds `doc/html/` in the source tree it was built from, first. Keep that, or restrict it to
  development builds?
- QMapTool keeps its wiki-built `QMTHelp.qch`: move it, or leave it?
- Translations: not decided. Check gettext once there is real text.
- `src/qmapshack/doc/QMSHelp.*` can go once the new help replaces it.
